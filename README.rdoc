1. Set up ruby, rails, git, and Heroku
2. Set up a new rails app Hello-World
3. Updated the index.html page to display my name.
4. Stored all code to Github
5. Deployed to Heroku

Issues - localhost:3000 was updated to display my name but the Heroku page was not updated. I fixed this by running git add, commit, push once more and then git push heroku master.
